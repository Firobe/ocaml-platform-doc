title: Documentation overview of the OCaml platform
---

This is an overview of the available resources, both official and not,
to understand and use the main tools of the OCaml platform. The goal is
to assess the current state of the documentation, and decide what
improvements should be prioritized. The list tries to be exhaustive for
official resources, but is not exhaustive for non-official resources
although it tries to include significant/useful external resources (such
as Real World OCaml).

The tools are roughly ordered in decreasing importance order (an
understanding of the tools near the top is absolutely necessary to be
productive in OCaml).

All resources are roughly categorized according to the
[Di치taxis](https://diataxis.fr/) documentation framework along the axes
of practial/theoretical and learning/working. Furthermore, for category
a resource can be rated 游릭,멇리맖r 游댮마ccording to these (arbitrary, vague
and subjective) criteria:

-   游릭맍or resources that are complete, up-to-date and well-written;

-   游리맍or resources that are not complete enough, or are austere to
    beginners;

-   游댮맍or resources that are out of date, or exist but with only the
    bare minimum of information, or are very hard to navigate.

Resources in **bold** are official ones: either written/published by the
authors of the tool or under the <https://ocaml.org> domain.

Furthermore, there are a few resources introducing the whole platform
and the interactions between some of the different tools:

-   **[OCaml best practices](https://ocaml.org/docs/best-practices)**

-   **[OCaml up and running](https://ocaml.org/docs/up-and-running)**

-   [Real World OCaml
    Ch.21](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/platform.html)

Overall one of the biggest problems for beginners is the segmentation of
the documentation. Even amonst official resources and for the same tool,
documentation lives on:

-   <https://ocaml.org/docs/>

-   <https://ocaml.github.io>

-   <https://opam.ocaml.org>

-   <https://dune.readthedocs.io>

-   the Github pages of the tools

Except when reading a course (such as Real World OCaml), a beginner will
most likely learn about a single tool without seeing the big picture of
the OCaml tooling. The [OCaml platform](https://ocaml.org/docs/platform)
page gives it blessing to a selection of tools but then leaves users on
their own to figure out how to install and use each tool.
